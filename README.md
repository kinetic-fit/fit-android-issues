# Public Issue Tracker for the Android Kinetic Fit Mobile Application 2.x Beta

![Kinetic Logo](https://github.com/kinetic-fit/fit-android-issues/blob/master/kinetic_logo.png)
## Getting Started
Thank you for your interest in helping make the Kinetic Fit even better. This private beta test ([opt in here](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.kinetic.fit)) will let us test our new version of the app before releasing it to everyone and allow us to smooth out any bugs that are found. For this beta test, we are looking for users who are frequent riders in the Kinetic App (2+ rides a week in Fit) and are willing to do the extra work required to test, report bugs to the issue tracker and work with our developers to reproduce and test fixes for any bugs that are found. Other lower frequency users are welcome to join the beta, but we are asking that anyone in the beta that experiences issues open an issue in the tracker and work with the dev team to fix the issues. We are committed to making Kinetic a better experience and are asking for the same commitment from our beta testers.
 
For the initial round of testing, we are looking for riders to use the Fit app, record their rides and save them. We are also looking to see that your ride data is sharing properly to other services (Strava, Training Peaks, etc) that can be linked in the app. If you have any of the third-party workout apps that Fit can share to, we would appreciate if you would share to those apps and double check that the data is correct. We have not changed the way that we store and serialize the data, but it is always good to recheck these connections and to make sure you can get your data out of Fit.

If at any point you feel like you want to use the public version on the store, you can go back to the opt in link, and follow the directions to remove the beta version from your phone. 

**NOTE: THE BETA DATABASE IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE DATABASE OF ANY OTHER VERSION OF FIT.** You will not be able to access beta workouts in other versions or vice-versa. If you leave the beta and go back to the public version, you will not have access to workouts you did on beta. Because of this, we strongly suggest using a third-party service to save your data. We currently offer connections to Strava, Training Peaks, 2Peak, MapMyFitness, and Google Fit as connections.  
 
## How to Test
When you log into the beta for the first time, you will use your current email and password. The new app will then find your current profile and begin to migrate data over. The new version should immediately pull your profile values over, so your HR zones, power zones, height, weight, and FTP should be set right away. The migration will then go through the last year of workouts you have stored on the old database and bring them over within 48 hours. You will not likely see any history in your main screen for the first day or two. If you do not see your sessions come over after 3 days, please open an issue in the tracker.
 
We will not need specific workouts or features tested by everyone. We should be able to cover all or most of the main features with a large enough pool of testers. The core of the app will always be workouts/free ride, calibration and sharing the data to other apps. Non-core things that can be tested are Custom HUDs, any of the sound options under settings and training plans are all available without a subscription. The Issue Tracker will have a list of the things our internal testers work through, so feel free to touch anything in there if you have the urge. We appreciate any little bit of extra testing we can get.
 
## Reporting Bugs
If you experience an error or notice an issue, please report them in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/kinetic-fit/fit-android-issues). This is a public page that we will use to track issues for Android beta testing and will alleviate customer support from tickets that can be opened directly with the developers. (iOS will have its own tracker [here](https://github.com/kinetic-fit/fit-ios-issues).) Please click on the Issues tab under the kinetic-fit/fit-android-issues header. Once there, please search the issues to see if your issue has already been reported. If it has, please add your experience to the issue in a comment. If it has not been reported previously, please open a new issue. No matter how you report, please use the [bug report template](https://github.com/kinetic-fit/fit-android-issues/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) to report your issue to make sure we have all of the information our developers need to get started on your issue.
 
Kinetic is finalizing a new web app, but at the start of this beta you will not have access to it. This means that you will only be able to access your data in the mobile app during the interim. Once this is available for beta testing, we will let you know and you would be free to use the features available there.
 
If you are interested in joining, please go to this [opt-in page](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.kinetic.fit) and follow the directions for joining and downloading the beta-version. It may take some time to get the update to your device. If you are having an issue, please go to the issue tracker and search/open an issue. Thank you for your help in making Fit better and for going the extra mile with us.
